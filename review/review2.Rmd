```
`[tibbles](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/)`
```

+ Great improvement. The mention to UK is still missing. Your description is good. Why not add :

> Access UK official statistics from the Nomis database through R

+ Nice examples! 

# Vignettes

+ still not ok when printing
+ Because the html in github is an old one
+ could use a makefile or git hook

# curl in description

+ I read something on that but I did not found it. It may worth ask on ropencsi [forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org/).

# Various

+ examples are ok
+ tests are ok
+ there is still commented code in your files. You may put same in seperate branches to clean your master if it is still work in progress.
